## Description

A REST API built using [NestJS](https://nestjs.com)

## Bun promotion

While this app *can* be built using NodeJS, it might be better if [Bun](https://bun.sh), which is a new super-fast Javascript runtime (which I am not affiliated with in any way), were used. The guides in this README will use Bun instead of NodeJS.

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install # NPM
$ bun install # Bun
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ bun run start

# watch mode
$ bun run start:dev

# production mode
$ bun run start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# e2e tests
$ bun run test:e2e
```
